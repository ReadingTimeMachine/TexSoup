\section{Waffles waffles waffles}

\subsection{Waffles are cooler than you}

Waffles have significantly more pockets than you.  

\[
P(W) > P(\rm{you})
\]

Ok, maybe you are at least as cool as waffles:

$$
C_{ool}(\rm{you}) \ge C_{ool}(W)
$$

Sometimes though, you might type things in silly ways $C_ {ool  } (\rm{anybody}) >   0$.

\begin  {equation}
C_{   ool} \ne 0
\end{equation }
